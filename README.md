# Thought Book ✍️  
_An offline-first and private space for your thoughts._  

---

## 🌍 Why Thought Book?  
Most note apps on laptops are slow, online-dependent, insecure, and leave your notes scattered and disorganized — like Notepad with its endless .txt files. I wanted a faster, private way to capture ideas instantly. Thought Book was built for exactly that:  

- 📝 Capture a thought the moment it comes.  
- 🚫 No internet required.  
- 🔒 Local and secure by default.

## 💡 Key Features  
- **Offline-only** by design — works currently on PC.  
- **Local encryption** to keep your notes private.  
- **Optional backup** (lightly encrypted) to Google Drive.
