# Contributing to Thought Book

Thanks for your interest in contributing! We welcome code changes, bug reports, feature requests, documentation updates, translations, and tests. This document explains how to contribute in a way that helps reviewers merge your changes quickly and gives credit to the project owners (TNR).

## Quick start (TL;DR)
- Fork the repo
- Create a branch: `git checkout -b feat/short-descriptive-name`
- Make changes, add tests, and run the app locally
- Commit with clear messages and push to your fork
- Open a Pull Request against `main` with a description and screenshots if relevant

## What we accept
- Bug fixes and stability improvements
- Small features that improve personal or common workflows
- Documentation or copy improvements (README, docs)
- Tests and small refactors that make the code easier to maintain

If you'd like to work on a larger feature, open an issue first to discuss the idea and design.

## Reporting issues
1. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.
2. Open a new issue with a clear title and steps to reproduce.
3. Include:
	- Environment (OS, Python version)
	- Steps to reproduce
	- Expected vs actual behavior
	- Minimal logs or screenshots

## Code contributions (pull requests)
1. Fork the repository and clone your fork.
2. Create a feature branch with a descriptive name: `feat/auto-backup`, `fix/db-error`.
3. Keep changes small and focused — one logical change per PR.
4. Write a clear PR description explaining the problem, the change, and any migration steps.
5. If the change affects behavior, add or update tests where feasible.
6. Use `Co-authored-by: Name <email>` in commits when collaborating on the same change.

Branching and commit guidelines
- Base work on the `main` branch.
- Use present-tense imperative commit messages, e.g. `Add autosave debounce`.

## Development setup (how to run the app locally)
The project is Python-based and uses plain scripts under the `scripts/` folder.

1. Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed.
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

	Windows (cmd.exe)
	```cmd
	python -m venv .venv
	.venv\\Scripts\\activate
	```

3. Install dependencies (if a requirements file exists) or the minimum listed below. If you don't have a `requirements.txt`, install the libraries the app imports (examples below). Run from repo root:

	```cmd
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```

	If `requirements.txt` is not present, the app commonly uses:

	```cmd
	pip install customtkinter requests
	```

4. Quick run (from repo root):

	```cmd
	python deploy.py
	```

	or (for direct run while developing):

	```cmd
	python main.py
	```

Notes
- `deploy.py` is the project's helper to prepare the app; running it should set up files and shortcuts for a local development experience.
- If you see errors about missing packages, install them into your venv and re-run.

## Project layout (high level)
- `main.py` — application entry & UI
- `deploy.py` — deployment/setup helper
- `scripts/` — application modules (utils, password manager, settings, etc.)
- `imgs/` — images and assets

Knowing where to make a change
- UI or behavior changes — `main.py` and `scripts/`
- Persistence and DB helpers — `scripts/utils.py`
- Settings and config — `scripts/settings.py`

## Tests
There are no required unit tests yet, but we appreciate tests for logic changes. If you add tests:
- Keep them small and fast.
- Prefer pure Python tests for non-GUI logic (utils, DB helpers).

## Style and linting
- Follow readable Python style (PEP8). We recommend using `black` and `flake8` locally but do not enforce them in CI yet.

## Review process
- PRs will be reviewed by a project maintainer.
- Expect feedback and be prepared to iterate; small changes speed up review.

## Attribution and credits (TNR)
We (TNR) maintain this project and appreciate contributions. By submitting a pull request you agree to license your contribution under the project's license.

To ensure contributors and TNR receive credit:
- Your GitHub profile will automatically be credited on the Pull Request and in commit history.
- We may add notable contributors to a `AUTHORS.md` or release notes. If you'd like a specific credit line, mention it in the PR description (how you'd like to be named).

If you want your changes to explicitly mention `TNR` as the project owner in a CHANGELOG or release note, maintainers will add that during release packaging. Feel free to add "Co-authored-by" lines to commits when appropriate.

## Code of Conduct
Be respectful, kind, and inclusive. We will not tolerate harassment or abusive behavior. If you experience or witness misconduct, contact the maintainers via an issue or email listed in the repo.

## Small contributions that help a lot
- Improve wording in README or docs
- Add a short HOWTO or troubleshooting note under `docs/`
- Add unit tests for `scripts/utils.py` functions
- Submit bug reports with detailed reproduction steps

## Need help?
Open an issue and tag it `help-wanted` or `good-first-issue` if you're new — we can suggest starter tasks.
